## The Discovery

We started Sidetool as an AI agency. We embedded in companies to understand their problems and build solutions.

While working with McDonald's on ordering systems, we met Tito from [Vana](https://vana.gt/), a microloan company in Guatemala. He had a different problem: "More than half my company, 200 people, just make collection calls all day."

This was different from other AI applications. Collections is simple: you either collect the money or you don't. The results are measurable.

We partnered with Tito to build an AI collections agent starting in June 2025. After 3 months, early results at Vana are promising: 25% higher recovery rates, 60% lower costs, and debtors actually prefer the AI.

Today, our AI can make hundreds of collection calls daily.

We're at $37K MRR with pipeline to reach $150K+ by December 2025 if deals close (4 months away). We've invested $100K of Sidetool's revenue to build Kleva. Sidetool currently funds our operations while we prove the model.

## The Problem

Here's what collections looks like in Latin America today:

**People hate this job:**
- Collections agents quit every 3 months
- They get yelled at all day
- Extreme burnout rates

**The scale is staggering and growing:**
- 77% of Brazilian families are in debt (30% heading to default)
- 60% of fintech loans go bad
- Argentina: Personal loan delinquency hit 4%+ (highest in 9 months)
- Most banks still use Excel to track everything

**The system is failing:**
- Collectors only recover 20 cents per dollar
- Everything happens over the phone
- Personnel costs are unsustainable
- Delinquency rising faster than banks can hire collectors

### The daily reality

**Without Kleva:** Maria shows up at 8 AM. Makes 80 calls. Faces verbal abuse 40 times. Maybe collects from 5 people. Goes home exhausted. Quits in 3 months.

**With Kleva:** Ana shows up at 8 AM. Sees Kleva made 5,000 calls overnight. Collected from 500 people. She reviews the tricky cases, adjusts the scripts, helps her small team handle escalations. Goes home feeling like she actually accomplished something.

## How It Works (Our Current Process)

Getting Kleva live is straightforward. We're developing this process with our early clients:

**Week 1-2: Integration**
- Connect to your core system (we support all major platforms)
- Import debtor data and payment history
- Set up telephony infrastructure

**Week 3: Training**
- Customize scripts based on your brand voice
- Configure compliance rules for your country
- Test with your team on real scenarios

**Week 4: Go Live**
- Start with 100 calls/day pilot
- Monitor and optimize in real-time
- Scale to full volume within days

Early clients see results quickly. Full deployment typically takes a month.

## The Surprise

We thought we'd just save Vana money. But our AI was actually better at collecting than humans.

Vana's results:
- Collected 25% more money
- Cost 60% less
- Works 24/7
- Never quits

But here's what surprised us: debtors preferred our AI. They opened up more. They paid more often.

Why? Our AI doesn't judge. It doesn't get angry. It has infinite patience. Tito taught us that good collectors don't threaten, they help. "Pay $200 today, and you're approved for a $500 loan next week."

We're trying to make collections more humane through AI.

## What We're Building

We're not making another tool. We're building an end-to-end intelligence platform for collections.

### Our Future Vision: From Calls to Complete Intelligence

Today, we make collection calls. Our roadmap includes building a complete collections intelligence platform:

**Ingest & Normalize**
We take data from any source (core banking systems, CRMs, spreadsheets) and unify it for consistent analytics and engagement.

**Intelligent Scoring**
We generate propensity scores that predict who will pay, when they'll pay, and through which channel, driving smarter segmentation.

**Behavioral Archetypes**
We assign psychological profiles based on behavioral science. Someone struggling with medical bills gets empathy. Someone gaming the system gets firmness. Tone, timing, and channel all adapt.

**Dynamic Engagement Journeys**
We deploy personalized outreach sequences that evolve in real-time. Not just calls, but coordinated campaigns across WhatsApp, SMS, email, and voice.

**Continuous Learning**
Every interaction feeds back into the system. What worked? What didn't? The platform gets smarter with every conversation, driving incremental improvements automatically.

### The Bigger Picture

We started with financial collections, but then ADT and DirecTV showed us something bigger: any company with subscription contracts has the same problem. With Sancor Seguros, we're exploring insurance. The addressable market isn't just financial services, it's every recurring payment business in Latin America.

After collections, we'll expand to:
- Dispute resolution
- Fraud detection  
- Credit reviews
- Customer retention
- Payment reminders

We see potential to expand to other repetitive finance roles.

We believe banks across Latin America will need this type of infrastructure. We handle the complexity (the tech, the compliance, the training) so they can focus on lending money.

## The Numbers

### Where we are now:

| What | Today | December | Growth |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Monthly Revenue | $37K (Aug 2025) | $150K (Dec 2025) | 4x |
| Call Minutes | 150K | 900K | 6x |
| Profit Margin | -74% | +22% | Profitable |

### Who's buying:

**Already using Kleva:**
- [Vana](https://vana.gt/) (microloans): $17K/month - fully deployed
- ADT (security subscriptions): $15K/month - currently 90K calls/month, scaling to 1M calls ($167K potential)
- DirecTV (satellite TV contracts): $5K/month - pilot with 6K contacts (12K minutes), scaling to 120-150K minutes ($20-25K potential)

*Note: ADT and DirecTV have millions of dollars in unpaid subscription contracts that need collection. ADT has customers who stopped paying for security monitoring but are still under contract. DirecTV has subscribers who discontinued service but owe remaining contract balances. Just like financial loans, these are legally owed amounts that require professional collection. With Sancor Seguros, we're exploring insurance premium collections.*

**Current MRR: $37K** (growing fast as ADT and DirecTV scale up)

**Closing Q3 2025 (September):**
- Diners Club Ecuador: $33K/month  
- Grupo Pichincha (Ecuador): $17K/month  
- Ficohsa (Guatemala): $33K/month
- Banco de Córdoba (Argentina): $30K/month
- Sancor Seguros (Argentina insurance): $45K/month

### The unit economics:

A typical lender with 10,000 bad loans:
- Currently pays: $80K/month for human collectors
- Pays us: $34K/month (200K minute package)
- Saves: $46K/month
- We keep: 48% gross margin today, reaching 56% at scale

**Our pricing model:** 
- Tiered pricing based on volume:
  - 40K minutes: $0.197/minute
  - 90K minutes: $0.184/minute
  - 200K minutes: $0.171/minute
  - 500K minutes: $0.158/minute
- Clients buy minute packages
- Month-to-month contracts
- No setup fees currently

### Early Unit Economics:

**What we know:**
- Zero churn so far (only 3 months of client data)
- Payback period: Under 1 month (clients pay $15-50K/month)
- Gross margins: 48% today, targeting 56%

**What we're still figuring out:**
- True CAC (so far just founder time)
- Actual LTV (too early to know retention patterns)
- Long-term churn rates
- How sticky the product really is

We need 12+ months of data to understand our real unit economics.

## How We'll Grow

### Taking over Latin America (Next 2 Years)

**First 6 months:**
- Close the deals we have
- Solidify presence in Guatemala, Ecuador, and Argentina
- Hit $150K+ monthly revenue

**Months 7-12:**
- Mexico (huge market, credit cards growing 46% per year)
- Colombia (hundreds of fintechs)
- Hit $500K monthly revenue

**Year 2:**
- Brazil (biggest opportunity: 77% of families in debt)
- Traditional banks ready to modernize
- $2M monthly revenue

### How do we get to $2M MRR

**Current Pipeline Math:**
- Live today: 3 clients = $37K MRR
- Closing Q4: 5 clients = $158K MRR
- Total by December 2025: $195K MRR potential

**To reach $2M MRR by Year 2:**
- Need ~40 enterprise clients at $50K average
- OR 20 large clients at $100K average
- OR mix of both (most likely)

**Sales team scaling:**
- Today: Ed (CEO) leading sales
- Q1 2026: Hire 2 enterprise sales reps
- Q2 2026: Add 3 more (5 total)
- Each rep closes 2 deals/quarter = 40 clients/year

**Why we think it's possible:**
- ADT alone can scale to $167K (1M calls)
- Each bank has 50K-500K delinquent accounts
- Would need roughly 0.5% market share to hit targets

## Why We're Starting with LATAM


**LATAM companies need solutions now.** Delinquency is surging. 30% of Brazilian families heading to default. Employment costs rising. They can't hire collectors fast enough. They need solutions now.

**Lower regulatory barriers mean faster deployment.** U.S. requires state-by-state licensing. LATAM lets us move fast, iterate, and learn.

**We're building our proof at scale.** By the time we enter the U.S. market, we'll have:
- Millions of successful collection calls
- Proven ROI across multiple countries and industries
- Battle-tested infrastructure
- A brand that financial institutions recognize

**U.S. companies want proven solutions.** They need to see millions of calls and recognized brands. We hope LATAM success becomes our U.S. entry point.

### Then America (With Full Compliance)

**What gives us an advantage:**
- We mastered Latin America's challenging phone infrastructure
- We already speak Spanish and English  
- We can charge less and still make money
- Building compliance infrastructure now

**How we'll enter (legally):**
- Q1 2026: Obtain licenses in key states via NMLS
- Q2 2026: SOC 2 certified, CLLA certification for B2B
- Start with lenders serving Hispanic communities (FDCPA compliant)
- Partner with fintechs like Affirm (young people don't mind talking to AI)
- Then go after the big banks with full enterprise security

## Our Competitive Advantages

### We get smarter every day

- Today: 150,000 minutes of calls = 150,000 lessons
- December 2025: 900,000 minutes projected
- 2026: Targeting 5-10 million minutes monthly

Every call teaches us:
- What words work
- When to call
- Who will pay
- How to negotiate

### The network effect (Legally Compliant)

When multiple lenders use Kleva, everyone wins. Here's how it works legally:

**What we track (anonymized):**
- Payment patterns by time of day/week
- Which negotiation strategies work best
- Response rates to different scripts
- Optimal number of contact attempts

**What we DON'T share:**
- Personal debtor information
- Individual payment histories  
- Client-specific data

Every client's interactions improve the system for everyone else. We aggregate learnings across millions of calls (which scripts work, when to call, how to negotiate) without ever sharing individual client or debtor data. It's collective intelligence built on anonymized patterns.

### What we've built

**Data advantage:** By December 2025, we project having 1-2 million conversations worth of learning.

**Trust and relationships:** Each successful deployment builds trust with other banks.

**Infrastructure maturity:** We can handle thousands of simultaneous calls. We've integrated with multiple banking systems. We're encountering and solving new edge cases daily.

## Leaving Sidetool Aside

We're going all-in on Kleva. Here's what happens:

**Month 1:** Kleva becomes its own company. Clean structure for investors.
**Month 2:** Move everything over: contracts, infrastructure, team.
**Month 3:** Everyone gets Kleva equity. No more distractions.

Ed (CEO) and JM (COO) will run Kleva full-time. The team follows. Sidetool continues separately with different people.

This isn't a side project anymore. It's everything.

## The Team

We have a team obsessed with the details that matter.

## Why Right Now

**Delinquency is surging everywhere and it's accelerating:**

The consumer debt crisis is getting worse, not better. This is a structural shift that makes our solution essential.

**Argentina:** Personal loan delinquency exceeds 4% (9-month high). Credit card arrears near 5%. Over half of households spend 40-60% of income on debt payments.

**Brazil:** 77.5% of families in debt. Nearly 30% projected to default by year-end. This represents tens of millions of accounts needing collection.

**United States:** 4.4% of consumer debt delinquent and rising. Even superprime borrowers (credit scores 781-850) saw 109% year-over-year rise in delinquencies. Student loan defaults at 5-year high with 6 million Americans significantly overdue.

**Why we believe this creates opportunity:**
- Banks can't hire enough collectors to handle growing volumes
- Rising delinquency means collections is becoming core to profitability
- Traditional methods (human agents at $3/minute) are unsustainable at this scale
- Every percentage point increase in delinquency = millions more accounts needing collection

**The tech finally works:**
- AI can actually hold conversations in Spanish and Portuguese
- Voice synthesis sounds natural
- Costs dropped 95% in two years
- WhatsApp integration enables reaching consumers where they communicate

**Other companies are trying to solve this too:**

**Colektia** ($15.6M raised, Chile/Mexico)
- Digital collections through WhatsApp/SMS campaigns
- Managing 15M accounts
- Traditional outsourcing model

**Altur** (YC S25, Mexico/US)
- Voice AI for collections
- $6M collected in pilots
- Focus on US compliance

**Murphy** ($15M raised, Europe)
- EU utilities and telecoms focus
- GDPR/European regulations

**Domu** (YC S24, US)
- Fortune 500 targets
- Licensed agency model in US

**What we've built:**
- We're live with paying customers generating real revenue
- Nicolás from MercadoPago brings deep LATAM collections expertise
- We work across finance, telecom, and insurance
- We deploy in 4 weeks
- We're processing ~150,000 minutes monthly (about 5,000 calls per day)

## What Makes Us Different

**We get Latin America:**
- Guatemalans say "pisto" for money, Mexicans say "lana"—we understand these nuances
- Collection laws change by country—we handle it
- Different cultures, different approaches—we adapt

**We built the hard stuff:**
- Phone systems that actually work
- Address detection better than Google
- Sub-second response times
- Months of painful debugging
- Security infrastructure (SOC 2 & ISO 27001 in progress with Strike.sh)

**We keep learning:**
- Every client makes every other client better
- Millions of conversations teach us what works
- Always more to learn

## Our Immediate Priorities

To scale from $37K to $150K+ MRR and beyond, we're focused on three critical areas:

**1. Specialized Agent Development**
- Creating bucket-specific agents for different delinquency stages:
  - Pre-mora (preventive outreach)
  - 1-8 days (gentle reminders)
  - 8-15 days (negotiation focus)
  - 15-30 days (settlement options)
  - 30+ days (hardship programs)
- Country-specific conversation flows (Brazilian Portuguese vs. Mexican Spanish vs. Argentine Spanish)
- Industry vertical customization (fintech vs. telecom vs. insurance)

**2. Compliance & Distribution**
- SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications (already working with Strike.sh)
- Country-specific regulatory frameworks for each market
- NMLS licensing for U.S. market entry
- Building compliant data handling for LGPD (Brazil), Ley 25.326 (Argentina), and FDCPA (US)

**3. Telephony Infrastructure at Scale**
- Building redundant systems to handle millions of concurrent calls
- Multi-provider architecture for 99.9% uptime across LATAM's challenging networks
- Real-time call quality monitoring and automatic failover

**Why this matters:** We believe these investments could reduce our onboarding time from 4 weeks to 1 week, helping us launch new clients faster.

## Risks We're Managing

**Regulatory Risk**
- *Challenge*: Collection laws vary by country and state
- *Our Progress*:
  - Working with Strike.sh for SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications
  - Starting U.S. state licensing process (NMLS system)
  - Pursuing CLLA certification for commercial collections
  - Local legal partners established in Guatemala, Ecuador, Argentina
- *Timeline*: SOC 2 by Q2 2026, U.S. licenses as we enter each state

**Technical Risk**
- *Challenge*: Telephony infrastructure in LATAM is fragile
- *Solution*: Multi-provider redundancy, already battle-tested with millions of calls

**Competition Risk**
- *Challenge*: Big tech or banks could build this
- *Solution*: We have local knowledge and industry expertise (Nicolás from MercadoPago)

**Market Risk**
- *Challenge*: Economic downturn could reduce lending
- *Solution*: Downturns actually increase delinquency and collections demand. We saw this with Argentina's 4% personal loan delinquency spike. Plus, subscription model diversifies us beyond just lending

**Execution Risk**
- *Challenge*: Scaling from $37K to $2M MRR
- *Solution*: Proven playbook, strong pipeline, experienced team
