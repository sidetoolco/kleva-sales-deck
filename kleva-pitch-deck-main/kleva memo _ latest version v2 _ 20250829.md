## The Opening: 

Six months ago, we were building restaurant agents. Today, we're solving a $67 billion problem in LATAM that nobody wants to talk about: debt collection.

Our AI agents collect debt better than humans while costing 70% less. Debtors actually prefer talking to them. And we're just getting started.

**The numbers are real**: We're on track to hit $150K MRR by December. Our pipeline supports $350K+ MRR. We've already invested $100K of our own money to prove this works.

This is the story of how we discovered a huge opportunity in LATAM fintech by accident, and why we're going to own it.

## The Discovery

We started Sidetool as an agency to build AI agents for companies. We would dive deep into companies, embedding ourselves to implement AI solutions. We traveled, we learned, we built.

One day we met Vana, a microloan company in Guatemala. When I met Tito, the cofounder and CEO, he pointed to a problem that would change everything. "You should look into collections," he said. "More than 60% of my company, over 200 employees, are doing collections."

At that moment, we were chasing order-taking agents for restaurants. McDonald's was exciting. The brand recognition was there. But after months of struggling with the restaurant industry's complexity and slow decision-making, we decided to listen to Tito.

Look, I'll be honest. Two years ago, I didn't know the collections industry. I thought building restaurant agents was the future. I was wrong. Tito showed me a problem so big, so painful, and so solvable that I couldn't look away. We're not collections experts who learned AI. We're AI experts who fell in love with solving collections. And that's exactly why we'll win.

Tito had another crucial insight: most AI agents were heading toward a race to the bottom in pricing. But collections was different. "This is one of the few opportunities where you can match the work directly to ROI," he told me. "Every dollar collected is measurable. As long as you do the plumbing right to integrate, you'll always be able to justify the service."

He was right. Unlike generic chatbots where value is hard to quantify, collections has clear, undeniable ROI. This isn't a commodity, it's infrastructure that pays for itself.

## The Problem

Let me paint you the reality of collections in LATAM today:

**The Human Cost:**

- **85% of collections agents** report extreme stress  
- **75-100% annual turnover** in collections departments  
- Agents face verbal abuse daily, leading to emotional burnout  
- Most quit within 3 months

**The Financial Crisis:**

- **77.5% of families in Brazil are in debt**  
- **60% delinquency rates** for fintech lenders in 2024  
- Mexico's credit card balances jumped **46% in one year**  
- Most financial institutions manage collections using Excel spreadsheets

**The Market Reality:**

- Collections is a multi-billion dollar problem in LATAM  
- 80% still happens via phone calls  
- Collectors recover only 20 cents on the dollar on average  
- Personnel costs account for 70% of call center expenses

### A Day in the Life: Before and After Kleva

**Before Kleva:** Maria arrives at 8 AM to her collections desk. She makes 40 calls by lunch. Gets yelled at 20 times. Collects from maybe 3 people. Takes a break to calm her nerves. Makes another 40 calls in the afternoon. Gets cursed at, threatened, hung up on. Collects from 2 more people. Goes home exhausted, demoralized. Quits after 3 months.

**With Kleva:** Ana arrives at 8 AM and opens her dashboard. Sees that Kleva made 10,000 calls yesterday, collected from 1,000 accounts, and flagged 50 for human review. She reviews the flagged cases, tweaks scripts based on performance data, and launches a new campaign targeting accounts 30-60 days overdue. She coaches the small human team on handling escalations. Goes home proud of actually solving problems instead of just dialing numbers.

## The Revelation

We thought we'd just save Vana money by automating calls. But what happened next shocked us.

Our AI agent was actually *better* at recovering money than humans. Not just cheaper. Better.

The numbers from Vana:

- **25% higher recovery rates** than their best human agents  
- **60% cost reduction** in operations  
- **24/7 availability** meaning more contacts at optimal times  
- **Zero turnover** \- the AI never quits

But here's what really blew our minds: Vana's customers preferred talking to our AI. They were more willing to negotiate, more likely to pay, and felt less harassed.

Why? Because an AI has infinite patience. It never shames anyone. It never loses its cool. It offers solutions, not threats. As Tito taught us, the best collectors don't demand money, they offer something: "Pay this $200 now, and you're pre-approved for a $500 loan next week."

We weren't just solving Vana's problem. We were making the entire collections experience more humane.

### Real Conversations:

## The Vision

We're not building another collections tool. We're building the AI workforce for LATAM's financial industry.

Starting with the collections agent—the hardest, most painful role in banking. After we perfect collections, we build:

- **Dispute Resolution Agents** (50% lower processing costs)  
- **Fraud Prevention Agents** (77% of consumers want this)  
- **Credit Review Agents** (continuous risk monitoring)

Eventually, every repetitive financial services role will have a Kleva AI agent that does it better, cheaper, 24/7.

Every bank and lender in LATAM will plug into Kleva's infrastructure to power their operations. We handle the complexity, the voice processing, the compliance, the integrations, the continuous learning, so they can focus on lending.

Every conversation makes our AI smarter. Every payment teaches it what works. We're building a learning machine that compounds in value with every interaction.

## The Proof

### Our Current Reality (July-December 2025\)

| Metric | Today | December 2025 | Growth |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **MRR** | $20K | $150K | 7.5x |
| **Minutes/Month** | 80K | 900K | 11x |
| **Gross Margin** | 48% | 52% | Improving |
| **Operating Margin** | \-74% | \+22% | Profitable |

### The Pipeline That's Already There

**Live and Expanding:**

- **Vana**: 100K minutes/month \= $17K MRR

**In Final Negotiations:**

- **Tandem**: 1M minutes/month \= $167K MRR  
- **Diners Club** (Ecuador): 200k mins/month \= $33K MRR  
- **Grupo Pichincha** (Ecuador): 100k mins/month \= $17K MRR  
- **Ficohsa** (Guatemala): 200k mins/month \= $33K MRR

### Unit Economics That Actually Work

For a mid-size lender with 10K delinquent accounts:

- **Their current cost**: $80K/month (45 human agents)  
- **Our price**: $24K/month  
- **Their savings**: $56K/month (70% reduction)  
- **Our margin**: 62.5% and improving

### We've Already Invested Everything

We believed in this vision so much that we funded it ourselves. Over $100K of Sidetool's profits invested into developing the technology, refining the AI, and getting clients live. No outside investors, no dilution, just pure conviction.

We bootstrapped our way to this moment. Now, with proven results and a massive pipeline, it's time to scale.

## The Team

We have a battle-tested team obsessed with the details that matter.

* **Gonza** (Product Owner): Lives in customer data, ensuring we add value every single day. Technical background means he understands both the business and the tech.  
* **Santi** (Lead Dev): Has spent an inhuman amount of time perfecting our orchestrator. Obsesses over prompt engineering, latency reduction, RAG implementation. Makes conversations feel natural, not robotic.  
* **Lila** (Problem Solver): When McDonald's needed address accuracy in LATAM (where Google Maps only achieves 70%), Lila built a solution with 94% accuracy in one weekend. This is the obsession level we operate at.  
* **Os** (Telephony Infrastructure): Built multi-instance Asterisk systems handling thousands of simultaneous calls without breaking a sweat. This is the unglamorous plumbing that makes everything work.  
* **Juli** (Quality & AI Supervisor): Reviews every call, catches edge cases, and is building an AI supervisor that automatically grades calls and suggests improvements.  
* **Muni** (Frontend): Creates the dashboards our clients love—clean, intuitive interfaces that make complex data actionable.  
* **JM** (Cofounder): Deep experience from leading customer success at Sirena (WhatsApp CRM). Gets customers to their "wow moment" in days, not months.

## Why Now?

This isn't just a good idea whose time has come. It's a perfect storm of technology, market conditions, and first-mover advantage.

### Technology Is Finally Ready

- **GPT and beyond**: Natural conversations in Spanish/Portuguese are now possible  
- **Voice synthesis**: Sounds human, not robotic  
- **Real-time processing**: Sub-second latency makes conversations feel natural  
- **Cost collapse**: What cost $1/minute two years ago now costs $0.06

### LATAM's Debt Crisis Is Accelerating

- **Post-COVID defaults**: Delinquency rates at historic highs  
- **Credit expansion**: More people have access to credit than ever  
- **Labor shortage**: Can't hire enough collectors even if they wanted to  
- **Regulatory pressure**: Governments demanding more humane collection practices

### Competition Hasn't Figured This Out

- **Colektia** is still using humans ($15M revenue, massive inefficiency)  
- **US companies** don't understand LATAM (it's not just Spanish translation)  
- **Local startups** lack the technical depth to build production-ready AI  
- **Banks** are too slow to build this internally

### We Have First-Mover Advantage

- **Proven results** with Vana already in production  
- **Deep relationships** with key players  
- **Battle-tested infrastructure** handling thousands of calls  
- **6-month head start** on anyone starting today

The window won't stay open forever. But right now, we're the only ones who have all the pieces.

## Our Moat

### It's Not Just About Technology

**Deep LATAM Understanding**

- This isn't Google Translate Spanish. It's understanding that Guatemalans say "pisto" for money while Mexicans say "lana."  
- Knowing that collection laws vary drastically between Colombia and Chile  
- Understanding cultural attitudes toward debt across different countries

**Battle-Tested Infrastructure**

- Os built systems handling thousands of simultaneous calls without dropping  
- Lila solved address accuracy in LATAM (94% vs Google's 70%)  
- Santi optimized latency to make conversations feel natural  
- This took months of obsessive iteration

**Compound Learning Effect**

- Every conversation makes our AI smarter  
- We're learning from millions of interactions across multiple countries  
- Each client benefits from learnings across our entire network  
- A competitor starting today would need millions of calls to catch up

**The Network Effect Nobody Sees**

- Every lender using Kleva makes every other lender's collections better  
- Why? Cross-portfolio intelligence. We know if someone paid Lender A yesterday, making them more likely to pay Lender B today  
- (All privacy-compliant, of course.)  
- This creates exponential value as more lenders join the network

**Trust and Relationships**

- Vana trusts us with their most sensitive customer interactions  
- Tito is our design partner, not just a client  
- Financial institutions don't switch vendors lightly  
- Every successful deployment makes the next sale easier

**The Plumbing Nobody Sees**

- Integration with all different core banking systems  
- Compliance frameworks for 7+ countries  
- Automated quality monitoring and improvement systems  
- Telephone system that connects at scale  
- This boring stuff is our real competitive advantage

## Building Voice AI That Actually Works

### The Technical Challenge

#### What Makes Our Agents Different

* **Separate Signal from Noise** Real calls are messy—background noise, kids crying, TVs blaring. Our AI filters what matters from what doesn't.  
* **Multitasking is Non-Negotiable** Our agents listen, think, and respond simultaneously. No awkward pauses, no dead air.  
* **Context is King** We remember what was said three calls ago. We adapt based on payment history. We know when to be firm versus empathetic.  
* **The Right Balance** Detailed enough to solve problems, concise enough to respect time.

#### Why Building This is Hard

It's easy to build a demo. It's nearly impossible to build production-ready AI agents that:

- Handle millions of calls without failing  
- Integrate with legacy banking systems  
- Comply with regulations in multiple countries  
- Learn and improve from every interaction  
- Never say something that could destroy a brand

We've solved these problems..

## The Ask

### Exactly How We'll Use the Money

- **Engineering**: Hire 2 senior engineers to build with Santi and Lila.  
- **Sales & Marketing**: Land 10 more financial institutions  
- **Infrastructure**: Scale telephony to handle 50M minutes/month  
- **Compliance & Legal**: Expand to Mexico, Colombia, and Peru

Every dollar is allocated to growth, not experimentation.

### The Investor We Would Love to Have

- **Emiliano (dLocal)**: Payment infrastructure expertise  
- **Juan Mini**: Deep financial services experience  
- **Tito (Vana)**: Our design partner living the problem  
- **Mike Peña (Banco de Galicia)**: Deep financial services experience  
- **Iungo**: Strategic connections

### What This Unlocks

With this funding, we will:

1. Scale to 50+ financial institutions  
2. Process 50M+ minutes monthly  
3. Build our more proprietary solutions (reduce costs by 60%)  
4. Expand the AI workforce beyond collections  
5. Become the infrastructure layer for LATAM finance

## Why This Matters

Every day we wait:

- 10k collections agents in LATAM burn out  
- Millions of debtors get harassed instead of helped  
- Billions in capital stays locked up in bad debt  
- Someone else gets closer to owning this market

We've built the solution. We've proven it works. Our clients love it. Their customers prefer it.

This is Kleva. This is our mission.
