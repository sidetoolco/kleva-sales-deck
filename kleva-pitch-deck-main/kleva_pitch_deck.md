# Kleva Pitch Deck

---

## Slide 1: Title
**Kleva**

AI that collects debt better than humans in Latin America

---

## Slide 2: Quick Intro

- Live with 3 paying clients ($37K MRR)
- 150,000 minutes of collection calls monthly
- Team of 9 from Sidetool (AI agency)
- Invested $100K of our own money to build this

---

## Slide 3: The Problem

**60% of Latin American fintech loans go bad**

Maria is a collections agent in Guatemala. She makes 80 calls a day. Gets yelled at 40 times. Collects from maybe 5 people. She'll quit in 3 months like everyone before her.

This is happening at every bank in Latin America.

---

## Slide 4: How They Solve It Today

**Banks throw humans at the problem**

- 200+ agents at each bank just making calls
- 75-100% annual turnover
- Excel spreadsheets to track everything
- Only recovering 20 cents per dollar

The system is completely broken.

---

## Slide 5: What If Instead...

**What if AI could make those calls?**

Never gets tired. Never quits. Works 24/7.
And debtors actually prefer talking to it.

That's Kleva.

---

## Slide 6: Our Solution

**Kleva: AI Collections Agents**

- Makes 5,000 calls per day
- 20% higher recovery rates than humans
- 60% lower cost
- Speaks perfect Spanish & Portuguese
- Never judges, infinite patience

## Slide 7: The Dream

**We're building the AI workforce for Latin American finance**

Start with collections (the hardest problem)
Then expand to every repetitive role in banking

This is a $67B market in LATAM alone.

---

## Slide 8: Traction

**From $0 to $37K MRR in 3 months**

[Chart showing growth]

- Vana: $17K/month (microloans)
- ADT: $15K/month (security subscriptions) 
- DirecTV: $5K/month (satellite contracts)

Pipeline: $158K MRR closing September

---

## Slide 9: Why We're Different

**Others use chatbots. We make phone calls.**

- **Colektia**: WhatsApp campaigns only
- **Traditional call centers**: $3/minute with humans
- **Us**: $0.17/minute with AI that works better

We handle the hardest channel (voice) with the best results.

---

## Slide 10: The Wave We're Riding

**Delinquency is exploding globally**

- Brazil: 77.5% of families in debt
- Argentina: Personal loans at 4%+ delinquency (9-month high)
- US: Even superprime borrowers defaulting 109% more YoY

Collections is becoming THE critical function for every lender.

---

## Slide 11: Why Now?

**The perfect storm:**

1. **Tech finally works**: GPT-4 speaks perfect Spanish/Portuguese
2. **Costs collapsed**: What cost $1/minute now costs $0.06
3. **Crisis accelerating**: Banks can't hire collectors fast enough
4. **LATAM ready**: Lower regulatory barriers than US

We couldn't have built this 2 years ago. Now we can.

---

## Slide 12: Why Us?

**We understand both AI and LATAM**

- **Ed**: Built Sidetool, embedded in 20+ companies
- **Nicolás Mencia**: 10 years in collections, ex-MercadoPago
- **Team**: 9 engineers who've been building AI agents for 2 years

We're not collections experts who learned AI.
We're AI experts who fell in love with solving collections.

---

## Slide 13: Next Milestone

**With this funding, by December 2025:**

- **Revenue**: $150K MRR (from $37K today)
- **Scale**: 1M minutes/month 
- **Clients**: 10 enterprise banks signed
- **Geography**: Operating in 5 countries
- **Team**: 15 people fully dedicated to Kleva

---

## Slide 14: The Bigger Vision

**Year 1**: Master collections
**Year 2**: Expand to dispute resolution, fraud detection
**Year 3**: Full AI workforce for finance

Every bank in LATAM will use Kleva agents.
Then we go to the US with proven results.

We handle the AI complexity. Banks focus on lending.
