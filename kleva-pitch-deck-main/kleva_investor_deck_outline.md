## Slide 2: The Team & Credibility

## Slide 3: The Problem
**Latin America's Collections Crisis**

- 77% of Brazilian families in debt
- 60% delinquency rate for LATAM fintechs
- Collections agents quit every 3 months
- Banks still using Excel and human callers
- Only recovering $0.20 per dollar owed

## Slide 4: Current Solutions Are Failing
**How collections works today:**
- 200+ human agents per bank
- 75-100% annual turnover
- Agents make 80 calls/day, collect from 5
- Verbal abuse leads to burnout
- Costs $3/minute with humans

## Slide 7: How We're Different
**Kleva vs Competition**

| Company | Approach | Price | Recovery Rate |
|---------|----------|-------|---------------|
| Call Centers | Human agents | $3/min | Baseline |

| **Kleva** | **AI voice calls** | **$0.17/min** | **+20% vs humans** |

## Slide 8: Traction
**Real Revenue, Real Growth**

- **Month 1**: $0
- **Month 2**: $17K MRR (Vana)
- **Month 3**: $37K MRR (Added ADT, DirecTV)
- **Pipeline**: $158K MRR closing September

**150,000 minutes of calls monthly**

## Slide 9: Market Opportunity
**$67B Collections Market in LATAM**

- Bottom-up: 500M delinquent accounts × $134 collected = $67B
- Top-down: Banks spend $11B on collections operations
- Growing 23% annually as delinquency rises

**If we capture just 1% = $670M revenue opportunity**

## Slide 10: Business Model
**Simple, Scalable Pricing**

- Charge per minute of calls (tiered pricing)
- $0.158-0.197 per minute
- 48% gross margins today → 56% at scale
- <1 month payback period
- Month-to-month contracts (low friction)

## Slide 11: Go-to-Market Strategy
**Land and Expand Across LATAM**

3. **Delinquency surge**: Up 109% even for prime borrowers
4. **Regulatory advantage**: LATAM easier than US to enter

**This couldn't be built 2 years ago. Now it can.**
